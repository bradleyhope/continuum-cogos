**DATE:** October 16, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Weekly Media Review: Lars Windhorst

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive review of significant media mentions of **Lars Windhorst** and his associated entities for the week ending October 16, 2025. The key themes emerging are significant legal and financial challenges, including the bankruptcy of his primary holding company, persistent tax enforcement in the UK, and the fallout from his past business dealings with H2O Asset Management and the Hertha BSC football club.

A fraud indictment against the new majority owner of Hertha BSC, who acquired Windhorst's stake, brings his name back into the spotlight. Simultaneously, a high-profile partnership with Nathaniel Rothschild, announced in 2024, officially dissolved this summer after legal disputes. Windhorst's main holding company, **Tennor Holding**, was declared bankrupt in the Netherlands in June 2025, while his UK-based private office faces its fifth winding-up petition from British tax authorities in two years. These events paint a picture of an individual facing mounting pressure from multiple jurisdictions.

## 2. Key Developments

### Tennor Holding Declared Bankrupt in the Netherlands

In what is arguably the most significant development, Lars Windhorst's primary investment vehicle, **Tennor Holding B.V.**, was declared bankrupt in June 2025. According to a report from the French financial publication *L'Agefi*, the bankruptcy was initiated at the request of Dutch tax authorities due to unpaid taxes. [1]

> Tennor Holding, la société de Lars Windhorst, a été déclarée en faillite à la demande des autorités fiscales néerlandaises. Cela fait suite au non-paiement de taxes aux Pays-Bas. Tennor Holding a emprunté des milliards auprès d'investisseurs, notamment H2O AM et ses clients.

This bankruptcy has significant implications, as Tennor Holding was the entity through which Windhorst managed his vast and complex portfolio, which included billions borrowed from investors like H2O Asset Management. This development followed a public apology from Windhorst to H2O investors in December 2024, where he promised to continue reimbursements from new business ventures.

### Fifth HMRC Winding-Up Petition Against UK Private Office

Adding to the financial pressure, Windhorst's UK-based entity, **Lars Windhorst Private Office Limited**, is facing its fifth winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) since 2023. An article by legal news site *Winding Up Petition Solicitors* describes this as an "unprecedented level of tax enforcement action" against a single company. [2]

**Timeline of HMRC Winding-Up Petitions:**

| Petition Number      | Date Filed         | Status / Last Update     |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| CR-2023-003802       | October 16, 2023   | Active until Jan 17, 2024 |
| CR-2024-002317       | April 23, 2024     | Last updated Jun 18, 2024 |
| CR-2024-004751       | August 6, 2024     | Active until Sep 27, 2024 |
| CR-2025-000247       | January 15, 2025   | Last updated Feb 28, 2025 |
| CR-2025-006383       | September 15, 2025 | Last updated Oct 7, 2025  |

While none of these petitions have yet resulted in a compulsory liquidation, the sustained pressure from HMRC indicates severe and persistent tax compliance failures in the UK, separate from the issues in the Netherlands.

### Indictment of 777 Partners, Successor to Windhorst at Hertha BSC

The fallout from Windhorst's ill-fated investment in Berlin's Hertha BSC football club continues. **Joshua Wander**, co-founder of Miami-based investment firm **777 Partners**, was indicted in New York on charges of a $500 million fraud. [3] 777 Partners acquired Windhorst's 78.8% stake in the club in 2023 after Windhorst's tumultuous tenure.

The indictment alleges that Wander and his firm defrauded lenders by pledging assets that did not belong to them and falsifying financial statements. While the charges are not directly related to Windhorst, the high-profile failure of his successor brings his disastrous €370 million investment in the club back into the public discourse.

### Dissolution of Partnership with Nathaniel Rothschild

A planned high-profile partnership between Lars Windhorst and financier **Nathaniel Rothschild, 5th Baron Rothschild**, has officially ended. The collaboration, announced in July 2024, would have seen Rothschild take an executive chairman role and a minority stake in Tennor.

However, the partnership quickly soured, leading to a lawsuit filed by Rothschild against Windhorst in January 2025 over an alleged defaulted personal loan. By August 2025, the parties had settled. In a statement, Rothschild confirmed the partnership never materialized: [4]

> Rothschild stated that "he had never taken up the planned role of executive chairman and had never made an investment in Tennor."

This collapse marks another significant setback for Windhorst, who had likely hoped the association with the Rothschild name would help restore his credibility.

## 3. Other Media Mentions

- **H2O Asset Management Fallout:** The legal and financial repercussions of H2O AM's investments in illiquid Windhorst-linked bonds continue. A French court recently rejected legal challenges, allowing investor lawsuits to proceed. [1] In the UK, a former H2O executive was fined £1 million by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). [1] Windhorst's name was also cited in a Mishcon de Reya legal publication as a case study in misleading the FCA. [5]

- **FSG Shipyard:** Recent news from *Shippax* indicates that Windhorst has taken over the insolvent German shipyard **Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft (FSG)**. [6] A related story notes the sale of the vessel *TENNOR OCEAN*—the first newbuild from FSG since Windhorst's initial 2019 investment—to Abu Dhabi's Safeen Group. [7]

## 4. Conclusion

The media landscape surrounding Lars Windhorst is dominated by themes of financial distress, legal battles, and the collapse of key business ventures and partnerships. The bankruptcy of Tennor Holding is a critical failure, and the persistent tax issues in multiple countries suggest deep-rooted solvency problems. The negative halo from the Hertha BSC investment and the public fallout with Nathaniel Rothschild further compound the damage to his reputation. While the FSG shipyard takeover indicates some ongoing business activity, the overwhelming narrative is one of crisis.
